# Python-practice
This repo is to push daily coding tasks to the git

There are day wise challanges and daily codes to push

Day1:

Shell Challenges :

Write a script to store your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1) in a variable and print it.
Prompt the user for an EC2 instance type and display it with a custom message.
Check if a file named deploy.sh exists in the current directory; print “Found” or “Not found.”
Write a script to check if a variable ENV is set to “prod”; exit with code 1 if not.
Create a script that takes a port number as input and checks if it’s between 1024 and 65535.
Write a script to compare two numbers passed as arguments and print which is larger.
(Bonus) Check if a directory /tmp/logs exists; create it if it doesn’t.

Python Challenges:

Store your name and AWS certification in variables and print them in a sentence.
Ask the user for a pod name and print it with a prefix like “Pod: <name>.”
Write a program to check if a file config.yaml exists (use os.path.exists).
Take a number as input and print whether it’s positive, negative, or zero.
Create a program to validate an AWS region input (e.g., must start with “us-” or “eu-”).
Compare two user-input strings and print if they’re equal (case-insensitive).
Write a program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.
(Bonus) Prompt for an EKS cluster name and check if it’s longer than 5 characters
